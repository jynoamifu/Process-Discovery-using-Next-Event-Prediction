# Process-Discovery-using-Next-Event-Prediction
This repository contains the python code belonging to the master thesis on Process Discovery using Next Event Prediction


Retrieving relevant information from data for decision-making can be a challenging task. Process Mining is part of the field of data science that analyses and improves operational business processes based on event logs. Deep learning methods are well-known for their predictive power while using large sets of data. This master thesis aims to perform process discovery using a deep learning technique to combine the benefits of both techniques. The proposed approach will generate a directly-follows graph from the predictions made by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. This research proves that the constructed process graph is of comparable strength to a process graph discovered by a traditional process discovery technique.
